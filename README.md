### Summary
  Programon is a multiplayer CLI-GUI-hybrid Pokemon battle simulator built with native Java libraries on Apache's Netbeans IDE. This game was developed by Team Roti Canai (Luke and I) in our very first semester for a programming fudamentals course (WIX1002 Fundamentals of Programming- OOP in Java). This was the very first program I ever coded in Java and is one I'm pretty proud of. While Luke and I have patched most of the bugs, it's still a diamond in the rough and could benefit from a rework in the future.
  
  Nonetheless, for our very first project, this was a pretty big achievement; having gone many days without sleep and only having 2 people to work on this assignment with a tight deadline, it covered all the required objectives of the assignment as well as extra features that got my group bonus points. Looking back, I've come a long way as a Java developer. It's always nice to reminisce on the past once in a while and look back to where it all began- with Programon.
