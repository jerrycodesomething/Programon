## Summary
  Programon is a multiplayer CLI-GUI-hybrid Pokemon battle simulator built with native Java libraries on Apache's Netbeans IDE. This game was developed by Team Roti Canai (Luke and I) in our very first semester for a programming fudamentals course (WIX1002 Fundamentals of Programming- OOP in Java). This was the very first program I ever coded in Java and is one I'm pretty proud of. While Luke and I have patched most of the bugs, it's still a diamond in the rough and could benefit from a rework in the future.
  
  Nonetheless, for our very first project, this was a pretty big achievement; having gone many days without sleep and only having 2 people to work on this assignment with a tight deadline, it covered all the required objectives of the assignment as well as extra features that got my group bonus points. Looking back, I've come a long way as a Java developer. It's always nice to reminisce on the past once in a while and look back to where it all began- with Programon.
  
## How to Run
#### Method 1
Clone the repo and run it in an IDE

#### Method 2
Download Submssion Release v1.0 and extract the files into a folder on your PC. Open a cmd prompt, powershell, or terminal of your choice in the program's directory and run the jar file.

(command: java -jar programon.jar)

## How To Play

2) Once a player chooses a Pokemon, the other player may not be able to pick the same Pokemon.

3) Players will take turns to equip items and fight based on their Pokemon's moves.

4) The winner will be decided when all of a player's Pokemon has fainted with the player that has one or more Pokemons still standing being crowned the winner.

5) Enjoy!
